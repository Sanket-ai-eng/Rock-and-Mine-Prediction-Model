# Rock-and-Mine-Prediction-Model

This project implements a binary classification model to predict whether a sonar signal is coming from a **rock** or a **mine** using logistic regression.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

The goal is to classify sonar signals as either:

- **Rock (R)**
- **Mine (M)**

This is a common benchmark dataset used to test the effectiveness of classification algorithms on binary labeled data based on frequency-based features.

## ðŸ§  Model Used

- **Logistic Regression**: A linear model used for binary classification.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `NumPy` for numerical operations
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation
  - `Scikit-learn` for model training and evaluation

## ðŸ§ª Technologies and Tools

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
